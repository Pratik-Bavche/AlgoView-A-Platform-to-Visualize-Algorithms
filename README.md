# 🚀 AlgoView – A Platform to Visualize Algorithms

AlgoView is an interactive algorithm visualization platform designed to help students and learners understand how algorithms work internally through clear, step-by-step visual representations. Instead of focusing on writing or executing code, AlgoView visually demonstrates algorithm logic, flow, and decision-making to improve conceptual understanding.

# 📌 Project Overview

Understanding algorithms is often difficult due to abstract logic and hidden execution flow. AlgoView solves this problem by transforming algorithms into interactive visual animations, allowing users to see how data structures change and how decisions are made at every step.

The platform supports a wide range of algorithms including sorting, searching, graphs, trees, dynamic programming, backtracking, and real-world optimization problems.
